and will evolve.

- Terminal and platform support research (Issues #20, #21)

## Phase 2: Expansion

- Cross-platform implementations (macOS/Linux schedulers)
- Multiple routing provider abstraction (Issue #14)
- Traffic density algorithm improvements (Issue #9)
- Improved location detection strategies (Issue #7)
- Release automation and version governance

## Phase 3: Strategic / Future

- Plugin system for custom segments
- Advanced caching and performance tuning
- Telemetry (opt-in) for usage insights
- Optional GUI configuration tool
